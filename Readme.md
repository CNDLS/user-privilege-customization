# User Privilege Customization Plugin for Omeka Classic
* This simple plugin modifies the default permissions for the Contributor User Level in Omeka Classic
* [Users - Omeka Classic User Manual](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Admin/Users/)
* This plugin uses the [define_acl hook](https://omeka.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Reference/hooks/define_acl.html) to add the privilege of making an Item public to the Contributor user role.
* This plugin was originally created for the [Rome Summer Class Omeka Site](https://romesummerclass.georgetown.domains), currently hosted on Georgetown Domains.
* The class is co-taught by Josiah Osgood <jo39@georgetown.edu> and Tommaso Astarita <astaritt@georgetown.edu>.
